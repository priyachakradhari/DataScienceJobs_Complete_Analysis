# SQL Case Study: Data Science Jobs Analysis

Welcome to my **SQL Case Study on the Data Science Jobs Dataset**! This project explores trends in data science job salaries, remote work, employment types, and more using **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **MySQL**. Below, you'll find an overview of the project, its components, and how to navigate the repository.

## üìã **Project Overview**
This project analyzes a dataset of data science job salaries to uncover key insights such as:
- Salary trends by experience level (Entry-level to Executive-level).
- The impact of remote work on salaries.
- Salary differences by employment type (Full-time, Part-time, Contract, Freelance).
- Geographic trends in salaries and company locations.

The project includes:
1. **SQL Queries**: Complex queries using WITH clauses, subqueries, stored procedures, views, and window functions.
2. **Power BI Dashboard**: An interactive dashboard to visualize key insights.
3. **Report File**: A detailed Word document with 20 questions, their SQL queries, and outputs.

üìä Key Insights
Here are some highlights from the analysis:

- Senior-level roles (SE) command the highest salaries, with a noticeable gap compared to entry-level roles (EN).

- Fully remote roles (100% remote) often offer competitive salaries, reflecting the growing demand for remote work flexibility.

- Full-time roles dominate the market, but freelance and contract roles are gaining traction, especially in tech hubs.

- Salaries vary significantly by employee residence and company location, with the US and Europe leading in compensation.

üìÑ Report Highlights
The report includes 20 questions with their SQL queries and outputs, such as:

- What is the average salary by experience level?

- How does remote work impact salaries?

- Which country has the highest average salary?

- What is the distribution of employment types?
